## Yash Chatse – Developer Portfolio

This is a modern, responsive developer portfolio for **Yash Gautam Chatse**, built with **React + TypeScript + Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**.

It showcases skills, projects, case studies, resume, and contact information for full‑stack / backend roles.

### 🧱 Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Font Awesome (icons)

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### 🏗 Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The optimized build is output to the `dist` folder. You can deploy that folder to static hosts such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

### 📁 Key Structure

- `src/App.tsx` – main single‑page layout and all sections (Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Case Studies, Journey, Resume, Contact)
- `src/index.css` – Tailwind and global styles
- `public/` – static assets (images, PDFs, resume)

### 📄 Resume

Place your latest resume at `public/resume.pdf`. The site has buttons to **view** and **download** this file.

### 📬 Contact

The Contact section exposes a simple form and email so recruiters and clients can reach out easily.

### ✨ Notes

- Light & dark modes are supported via a toggle in the header.
- Project cards include placeholders for **Live Demo** and **Source Code** links – update these with your actual URLs.
